The client is oblivious to any change, which shifts your focus from the 'just in case' to 'just in time' model of purchasing storage space.\n\nDeduplication and Compression \nDetect and eliminates identical blocks; those blocks are then replaced with reference to a single copy of the block on disk, so it saves you a lot of space.\n\nOn the other hand, compression detects and eliminates redundant data and white space in files.\n\n Resiliency \n\nIf any component failed there is another component to add as a backup. \n\nCentralized management \n\nIt's much easier to manage all your storage from a centralized location rather than separately across all your servers.\n\n Storage Tiering\n\nThe system can have a wide range of storage media for different purposes, SSD (caters to hot data), SATA (caters to cold data) ..so on \n\nDisaster recovery and load balancing\nReplicate the data to a disaster recover site.\nAllow for load balancing. \n\n Virtualization support \n \nOne of the virtualization hallmarks is moving virtual servers between physical servers on the fly while they are still running.

When CPU contention occurs, the ESXi host time-slices the physical processors across all virtual machines, so each virtual machine runs as if it has its specified number of virtual processors.\n\nThe first virtual machine needs to execute a set of commands on the virtual hardware, and that request is directed to the hypervisor.\nThe hypervisor schedules an execution session for that virtual machine's request.\nThe physical CPU executes the instructions on the associated data and passes the results back to the hypervisor, which returns them to the first virtual machine.\nAs the physical CPU frees up, the hypervisor schedules the next set of instructions from the second virtual machine to be performed\n\nAlso, virtual CPUs are not mapped to physical CPUs. A hypervisor will schedule work on behalf of a virtual machine on any available physical CPU, so the work from a particular virtual machine might actually be run on any and all of the host processors over a period of time.\n\nWhat happens when you add vCPUs to virtual machines? If you have a virtual machine with two vCPUs, the hypervisor will need to schedule work on two physical CPUs. That means two physical CPUs would need to be available at the same time for the work to be performed. Don't forget, virtualizing a CPU is really just scheduling slices of time on the physical CPU. In the case of a VM with more than one vCPU, you need more than one physical CPU to be available to do the work.\n\nLimit CPU features exposed to virtual machines. \nYou can mask some of the CPU features to not be exposed to the virtual machine; a common example is \"AMD No eXecute (NX)\" and  \"Intel eXecute Disable (XD)\". It is considered a common practice when you plan to migrate those virtual machines to hosts that do not include those capabilities.",

Remember that the secret is in the sizzle - heated food releases fat that drips onto the charcoal and creates the smoke that makes your BBQ food tastes so good.\n\nHow long disposable grills remain hot\n\nDisposable grills tend to stay hot enough for BBQ for 1.5 hours thereafter ignition.\n\n Disposing the disposable grill\n\nOnce you’re done with BBQ is over, you need to put out them safely.\n\nEither Sand or water will be fine for this purpose, always protecting your hands. Once extinguished, leave the BBQ to cool down completely before dumping it safely. these types of grill are not designed for recycling so don’t throw them into the recycling bin.\n",

Awad'\n---\n\nRegression toward (or to) the mean is the phenomenon that arises if a sample of a random variable is extreme, a future sample will be closer to the mean or average on further measurements !--more--\n\nWhy Does Regression to the Mean Happen?\n\nRegression to the mean tend to happens due to sampling error. A proper sampling method is to randomly sample from the population. If you don’t (i.e. if you asymmetrically sample), then your results may be abnormally high or low for the average and therefore would regress back to the mean. Regression to the mean can also happen because you take a very small, unrepresentative sample (say, the highest 1 percent of the population or the lowest ten percent).\n\n Regression to the mean and co-relation\n\nWhenever the correlation between two variable is imperfect, there will be regression to the mean.\n\nReal life examples\n\nThe Sports Illustrated jinx is a good case in point of regression to the mean. The jinx states that whoever appears on the cover of SI is going to have a poor following year (or years). But the “jinx” is actually regression towards the mean. Most players have good games, and they have bad games. A winning streak is usually just that: a lucky streak. And it leads to being on the cover of SI. But it’s statistically likely to be followed by a fall back to average performance.\n\nOur mind try to search for causality, ignoring the regression part\n\n Correction\n\nStart with an estimate of the average (assuming there is no relation)\nDetermine the value that matches your impression of the evidence.\nObtain / Estimate the correlation .\nIf the correlation is .30, move 30% of the distance from the average to the matching impression.\n\nExample\n\nRelationship between the quality of the CEO and successful firms\n\n Correlation\n\nA very generous estimate of the correlation between the success of the firm and the quality of its CEO might be as high as .30, indicating 30% overlap.\n\nYour Impression of the evidence\n\nIn a well-ordered and predictable world, the correlation would be perfect, and the stronger CEO would be found to lead the more successful firm in 100%\n\n Average\n\nIf the relative success of similar firms was determined entirely by factors that the CEO does not control (call them luck, if you wish), you would find the more successful firm led by the weaker CEO 50% of the time.\n\nCorrection formula\n\nStronger CEO = AVG + (DISTANCE between impression and AVG) - correlation\nSuccessful CEO = 50 + (100 -50) \\* .3 = 50 + 15 = 65%\n",

Awad\"\n---\nWhat is software-defined data center?\nThe software-defined data center approach extends industry-leading virtualization beyond computing, network and storage, making data center services painless in terms of configuration and managing virtual machines.\n\nThe SDDC integrates those virtualization layers, creating a single, hyperconverged environment that facilitates IT resources delivery as a service — without regard to whether the SDDC is deployed in a private, public or hybrid cloud environment. A single management platform standardizes management across the virtualization layers and enables policy-based automation that simplifies operations.\n\n Software-defined data center components\n\nCloud Management Layer\nSevice Catalog: The Cloud Management layer comprises the service catalog that houses the facilities to be deployed. Catalog items are unique applications, infrastructure, or other services accessible in the catalog. \n\n The orchestration offers the workflows to deploy catalog items; for example, you can give it a list of the servers' IPs,  with a base of hypervisor installed on them, and request a workload domain; from this point onwards, it will orchestrate and take care of all the components into it, therefore it will make sure all the hosts have the same hypervisor installed and deploy the software-defined networking, etc.\n   \n a self-service portal that allows end-users to use the SDDC.\n\n Virtual Infrastructure Layer \n\nDecoupling resources from the physical layer,  additional processes, and technologies build on top of the infrastructure to bring forth infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).\n\nHypervisor. \nResource Pooling, when creating your clyster , you can create a virtual pool when you say how much resources individual logical groups, for example, if we have three different types of applications A, B, and C, you can say application A should have 50% of the resources we have and B, C 25% each so you can do that through resource pooling, or you can say first come first served.\nVirtualization control.\n\nPhysical layers \nCompute.\nNetwork, you need a physical network connected to the servers to access the servers and the virtual machines.\nStorage, for example, block storage, file storage, and a variety of others.\n\n Business Continuity\nFault Tolerance: If you need to have an immediate failover, you still have to have a cluster solution, but you still enable individual virtual machines fault tolerance. By   having a standby copy of the same VM, so if the host that has the virtual machine fails, it  can switch automatically to the other VM.\n   \nDisaster recovery, so you can have a replication goes to another site. If one of the sites, the whole data center loses power, burns down, or even explodes, you can have a ready a secondary site where you have a constant replication; you can switch over.\n   \nBackup and restore: The general rule of having your backup in multiple locations, one of them should be offline, that what you supposed to have, one use case if you hit by cryptolocker, so if the datastore is encrypted and you have your back settings in the same site, there is a very high chance the backup will be affected as well.\n\nSecurity \nCompliance, for example, if you are working in healthcare so your infrastructure should be compliant.",

On the flip side, SATA doesn't work that well when it transfers data out of the storage drive.\n\nSAS (Serial attached SCSI)\nSevers typically support SAS (Serial attached SCSI) pronounced \"scuzzy\" or Serial Attached Small Computer System Interface, which provides higher performance than SATA in server environments.\n \nYou can have SAS in your PC; that being said,  you won't get as much performance because they optimized for server environments where multiple clients are accessing the disk simultaneously.\n\nAgain SAS is beyond media type and connection; it's architecture as well.\n\nUnlike SATA, SAS has backward compatibility; your SAS drive bay, whether in your server or your storage system, can take SAS SSD, SAS HDD, SATA SSD, SATA HDD drives.

After the wheel is spun, subjects are asked a totally unrelated question: What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN? The average estimate of people who have just seen the number 10 is 25%. The average estimate of people who have just seen the number 65 is 45%. The answers are anchored by the previous information, even when there was no link between them.\n\nIn Kahneman’s new book, he writes, “When confronted with a problem — choosing a chess move or deciding whether to invest in stock — the machinery of intuitive thought does the best it can. If the individual has relevant expertise, she will recognize the solution, and the intuitive solution that comes to her mind is likely to be correct.” But when the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available? We answer an easier and related question. If the question is “Should I invest in Ford Motor Company stock?” the easier question to answer is “Do I like Ford cars?”\n\nInvesting, playing chess, weighing a management dilemma — the processes are similar. “This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution,” says Kahneman.\n",

The respondents were told to imagine that they used an insecticide where the risk of inhalation and child poisoning was 15 per 10,000 bottles. A less expensive insecticide was available, for which the risk rose from 15 to 16 per 10,000 bottles. The parents were asked for the discount that would induce them to switch to the less expensive (and less safe) product.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the parents in the survey responded that they would not purchase the new product at any price! They were evidently revolted by the very idea of trading the safety of their child for money.\n\nThe minority who found a discount they could accept demanded an amount that was significantly higher than the amount they were willing to pay for a far larger improvement in the safety of the product.\n\nAnyone can understand and sympathize with the reluctance of parents to trade even a minute increase of risk to their child for money. It is worth noting, however, that this attitude is incoherent and potentially damaging to the safety of those we wish to protect. Even the most loving parents have finite resources of time and money to protect their child (the keeping-my-child-safe mental account has a limited budget), and it seems reasonable to deploy these resources in a way that puts them to best use.\n\nMoney that could be saved by accepting a minute increase in the risk of harm from a pesticide could certainly be put to better use in reducing the child’s exposure to other harms, perhaps by purchasing a safer car seat or covers for electric sockets.\n\nsockets. The taboo tradeoff against accepting any increase in risk is not an efficient way to use the safety budget. In fact, the resistance may be motivated by a selfish fear of regret more than by a wish to optimize the child’s safety.\n",

Awad\"\n---\nWhen you create a virtual machine, you have to elect storage, and you have two options, thick and thin, so what are thick provisioning and thin provisioning, and how they differ.\n\nThin Provisioning\nAllocates storage as needed. It's cost-effective and mostly used for file/objects' storage; the S3 bucket is an example.\n\n Thick provisioning \nThick storage allocates virtual storage at the time of the request, so let's say you decide you're going with two terabytes of storage, which means you will get all of the two terabytes at the time of creation. \n\nOf course, it’s quite likely that you will end up not using all of those two terabytes, so obviously it's not space-efficient, but on the upside, it gives a performance hit as the storage doesn't need to grow at the time you need to. Mostly used for creating virtual DAS, in AWS, it's used EBS volume. \n\nSo why to go with think provisioning?\n\nBefore any blocks could be used, the blocks have to zero first, so if you are writing some data, the block that is being written to it has to have 0 in it, which can take a little time and consumes resources.\n\n Thick-provisioning Eager-zeroed\nIn the case of thin provisioning, the implications of that 0 initialization will delay the actual data being written to the block.\n\nSo, in the case of an intensive writing workload like SQL virtual machine or SharePoint, eager-zero thick provisioning is recommended.\n\nOne drawback of Eager-zeroed, though, it requires more time to delete all write the data at the time of the creation.\n\nThick-provisioning lazy-zeroed \nLike eager-zeroed lazy zeroed disk, it takes all of the space at creation time, but this space may still hold some old data. This old data will be deleted and zeroed as needed.",

NVRAM file is  not subjected to power outages, so information is retained even when the computer is turned off; again, you don't need to mess with this file.\n\n.log: log files, which is very useful in troubleshooting if you want to know, for example, what is happening in the boot process of the virtual machine\n\n.vmtx:  .vmtx file is created when you convert a virtual machine to a template. The .vmtx file replaces the virtual machine configuration file (.vmx file). The extension's change makes sure the file is no longer treated as a .vmx file; therefore, typical virtual machine-specific tasks such as power-on or reset can no longer be executed against it.\n\n.vmdk:The .vmdk file (also called the descriptor) is a text file that contains configuration information about a VM's virtual hard drive. The descriptor file also contains a reference to the large data (flat-vmdk) files as well as information on the virtual disks drive sectors, heads, cylinders and disk adapter type.\n\n.flat-vmdk: The *-flat.vmdk file is the virtual equivalent of a physical hard drive; this is where raw data is written.\n\n Snapshot-related files\n\nWhen a snapshot is taken, multiple new files are created in the VM folder. These include .vmdk, -sparse.vmdk, .vmsd, and .vmsn, as shown at the following screenshot\n\n.vmdk: snapshot disk file\n*.snapshot.vmsm\n*.snapshot#.vmen memory content of the sanpshot \n\nSuspended-VM-related files\nwhen you put the VM in suspend mode\n.*vmss suspended file state\n.*vmem suspended snapshot memory state",
