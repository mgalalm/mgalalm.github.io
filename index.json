Mostly used for creating virtual DAS, in AWS, it\u0026rsquo;s used EBS volume.\nSo why to go with think provisioning? Before any blocks could be used, the blocks have to zero first, so if you are writing some data, the block that is being written to it has to have 0 in it, which can take a little time and consumes resources.\nThick-provisioning Eager-zeroed In the case of thin provisioning, the implications of that 0 initialization will delay the actual data being written to the block.\nSo, in the case of an intensive writing workload like SQL virtual machine or SharePoint, eager-zero thick provisioning is recommended.\nOne drawback of Eager-zeroed, though, it requires more time to delete all write the data at the time of the creation.\nThick-provisioning lazy-zeroed Like eager-zeroed lazy zeroed disk, it takes all of the space at creation time, but this space may still hold some old data.

A single management platform standardizes management across the virtualization layers and enables policy-based automation that simplifies operations.\nSoftware-defined data center components Cloud Management Layer   Sevice Catalog: The Cloud Management layer comprises the service catalog that houses the facilities to be deployed. Catalog items are unique applications, infrastructure, or other services accessible in the catalog.\n  The orchestration offers the workflows to deploy catalog items; for example, you can give it a list of the servers\u0026rsquo; IPs, with a base of hypervisor installed on them, and request a workload domain; from this point onwards, it will orchestrate and take care of all the components into it, therefore it will make sure all the hosts have the same hypervisor installed and deploy the software-defined networking, etc.\n  a self-service portal that allows end-users to use the SDDC.\n  Virtual Infrastructure Layer Decoupling resources from the physical layer, additional processes, and technologies build on top of the infrastructure to bring forth infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).\n Hypervisor. Resource Pooling, when creating your clyster , you can create a virtual pool when you say how much resources individual logical groups, for example, if we have three different types of applications A, B, and C, you can say application A should have 50% of the resources we have and B, C 25% each so you can do that through resource pooling, or you can say first come first served. Virtualization control.  Physical layers  Compute. Network, you need a physical network connected to the servers to access the servers and the virtual machines. Storage, for example, block storage, file storage, and a variety of others.  Business Continuity   Fault Tolerance: If you need to have an immediate failover, you still have to have a cluster solution, but you still enable individual virtual machines fault tolerance. By having a standby copy of the same VM, so if the host that has the virtual machine fails, it can switch automatically to the other VM.\n  Disaster recovery, so you can have a replication goes to another site. If one of the sites, the whole data center loses power, burns down, or even explodes, you can have a ready a secondary site where you have a constant replication; you can switch over.\n  Backup and restore: The general rule of having your backup in multiple locations, one of them should be offline, that what you supposed to have, one use case if you hit by cryptolocker, so if the datastore is encrypted and you have your back settings in the same site, there is a very high chance the backup will be affected as well.\n  Security Compliance, for example, if you are working in healthcare so your infrastructure should be compliant.\n","permalink":"https://mgalalm.github.io/posts/software-defined-data-center-sddc/","tags":["virtualization","devops"],"title":"Software Defined Data Center SDDC"},{"categories":null,"contents":"IPV6 protocol offers several benefits over IPV4, as its ability to handle packets more efficiently, boost performance, and security improvement.\nFurthermore, it allows internet service providers to reduce their routing tables footprint by turning them to be more hierarchical.\n","permalink":"https://mgalalm.github.io/posts/ipv6-benfits/","tags":["network"],"title":"IPV6 Benfits"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Bearish Harami Consists of an unusually large green body followed by a small red body (contained within large green body).

So what\u0026rsquo;s the catch?

Remember that the secret is in the sizzle - heated food releases fat that drips onto the charcoal and creates the smoke that makes your BBQ food tastes so good.\nHow long disposable grills remain hot Disposable grills tend to stay hot enough for BBQ for 1.5 hours thereafter ignition.\nDisposing the disposable grill Once you’re done with BBQ is over, you need to put out them safely.\nEither Sand or water will be fine for this purpose, always protecting your hands.
